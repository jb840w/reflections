Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: Initializing a repository sets up a hidden directory structure for all future commits.
   We do this so git will know where to store and look for changes.

Q: How is the staging area different from teh working directory and the repository? What value do
   you think it offers?
A: The staging area simply logs what changes you wish to make when you decide to commit, it does no
   action by itself.  The value is in it's ability to help you think through your logical grouping.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A: specifically using the diff command in conjunction with the active staging area will allow
   you to see the changes that have been made.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
   How would branches help?
A: Specifically for me when I go to add new features or functionality to my app.  Branches will
   allow me to test out these new features without actually impacting the main funtional code
   base.

Q: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
A: Diagrams are always useful for helping you to see a logical flow to decisions that are made.
