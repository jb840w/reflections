Q: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: very useful if you are away from your personal/work comptuer

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
   up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Similar to earlier answers, the later provides for more personal control over the logical flow
   of push and commit.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead
   of another?
A: forks are specific to GitHub in that it creates a new copy of the project in your user account.
   clones create a new copy of the project but can be either local or on github.  branches can 
   also exist in either local or remote.
