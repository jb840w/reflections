Q: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: very useful if you are away from your personal/work comptuer

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
   up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Similar to earlier answers, the later provides for more personal control over the logical flow
   of push and commit.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead
   of another?
A: forks are specific to GitHub in that it creates a new copy of the project in your user account:
   this is useful when you want to work a project that you don't own or if you would like to make 
   changes without compromising the original file.  Clones create a new copy of the project but can
   be either local or on github: Cloning specifically works when you are the project owner.  Branches
   can also exist in either local or remote versions: Branching is most useful when you have a functional
   line of code but would like to either add to it or change it in a way that may be initally unstable.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: I suppose it can tell you who the most recent collaborator was.


Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? what would be easier, what would be harder?
A: Probably a mixture of email/dropbox/icloud.  It might be "easeir" if the person I am collaborating 
   with doesn't know how to use git or github.  It would absolutely be harder because we may have 
   multiple un-synced version control systems in play.
